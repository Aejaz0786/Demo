Hello world its me, Aejaz Ahmad.  i am trying to become as devops engineer and yes i can do it. as i don't have any background related to it sector. but yes now as i m learning then concluded that any body who has either it experience or not they can learn Devops even effectively.
moral of the story is that to become as a DevOps Engineer you no need to have necessary it background it is just a process not coding
